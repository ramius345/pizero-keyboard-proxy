# pizero-keyboard-proxy
A small go program to proxy a bluetooth keyboard as a connected USB HID keyboard.


TODO: add more info.  This is a simple go program that is based on the concept presented here https://randomnerdtutorials.com/raspberry-pi-zero-usb-keyboard-hid/

This only proxies the subset of keys on my not complete 101 key keyboard.
